            <li>This is an <strong>interactive checklist</strong> for all pets that have finished training.</li>
            <li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You must complete these tasks in the <strong>order they are presented.</strong></li>

            <li>Only the top-most, highest-priority task is active. All others are disabled. As you complete one, the next becomes available.</li>

            <li><strong>Service Block:</strong> This is calculated <strong>automatically</strong> based on the house's division to ensure a balanced workload for your 3-shift system. You don't need to manage this.</li>

                    <li><strong>Single Click `Start Pet`:</strong> Instantly starts the timer with the correct, pre-configured duration for that NPC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Long Press (Hold) `Start Pet`:</strong> Opens a popup to manually enter the time remaining. Perfect for syncing pets that were already in progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Triple-Tap a Running Timer:</strong> Instantly completes the timer. Useful for testing or correcting mistakes.</li>
